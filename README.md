The RelationalAI (RAI) SDK for Python enables developers to access the RAI
REST APIs from Python.

* You can find RelationalAI Python SDK documentation at <https://docs.relational.ai/rkgms/sdk/python-sdk>
* You can find RelationalAI product documentation at <https://docs.relational.ai>
* You can learn more about RelationalAI at <https://relational.ai>

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Python 3.7+

### Installing the SDK

Install using pip:

```console
$ [sudo] pip install rai-sdk

```

Install from source using pip:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:RelationalAI/rai-sdk-python.git
$ cd rai-sdk-python
$ [sudo] python3 setup.py install
```

Install from source in `editable` mode.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:RelationalAI/rai-sdk-python.git
$ cd rai-sdk-python
$ [sudo] pip install -r requirements.txt
$ [sudo] pip install -e .
```

### Create a configuration file

In order to run the examples and, you will need to create an SDK config file.
The default location for the file is `$HOME/.rai/config` and the file should
include the following:

#### Using OAuth Client Credentials

Sample configuration using OAuth client credentials:

```conf
[default]
host = azure.relationalai.com
client_id = <your client_id>
client_secret = <your client secret>

# the following are all optional, with default values shown
# port = 443
# scheme = https
# client_credentials_url = https://login.relationalai.com/oauth/token
```

Client credentials can be created using the RAI console at https://console.relationalai.com/login

#### Using API Access Key Credentials

Sample configuration using API access key credentials (deprecated):

```conf
[default]
host = azure.relationalai.com
port = <api-port>      # optional, default: 443
scheme = <scheme>      # optional, default: https
access_key = <your public access key>
private_key_filname = <name of file containing private key>
```

Note, the SDK expects to find the private key file in the same folder as the
config file.

You can copy `config.spec` from the root of this repo and modify as needed.

## Generate python protobuf sources from protobuf specification

```shell
python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I railib/pb --python_out=./railib/pb railib/pb/*.proto
```

## Examples

Each of the example files in the `./examples` folder is standalone and can be
run from the command line, eg:

```console
$ cd examples
$ python3 ./list_engines.py
```
